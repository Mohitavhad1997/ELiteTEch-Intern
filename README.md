# Employee Productivity and Salary Analysis

## Overview
This project uses Python to analyze employee data through **predictive modeling**, **clustering**, and **data visualization**. It demonstrates how machine learning can predict productivity levels and segment employees by salary trends to enhance data-driven human resource management.

### Key Features
1. **Predictive Modeling**:  
   - Uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict **employee productivity levels** based on experience, salary, and hours worked per week.  
   - **Accuracy** and a detailed **classification report** are generated for model evaluation.

2. **Clustering Analysis**:  
   - Implements **K-Means Clustering** to classify employees into **Low Salary**, **Mid Salary**, and **High Salary** groups.  
   - Clusters are defined using salary and experience data for actionable segmentation.

3. **Interactive Data Visualizations**:  
   - **Scatter Plot**: Relationship between **experience** and **salary** with salary clusters.  
   - **Bar Chart**: Visualization of **productivity levels** across different salary groups.

### Tools and Libraries
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis  
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models (Random Forest, K-Means)  
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations  
- **OpenPyXL**: Writing results to Excel

## Files and Outputs
- **`employee_productivity_analysis.xlsx`**: Contains employee data, model accuracy, and cluster labels.  
- **`salary_vs_experience.html`**: Interactive scatter plot visualization of salary vs. experience with clusters.  
- **`productivity_vs_salary.html`**: Interactive bar chart of productivity vs. salary.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd employee-productivity-analysis
   ```
2. Install the required packages:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn plotly openpyxl
   ```
3. Run the main script:  
   ```bash
   python employee_analysis.py
   ```
4. Open the generated **HTML** files in a browser to view the interactive visualizations.

## Results Summary
- **Predictive Model Accuracy**: {accuracy:.2f} (replace with your actual value)  
- **Salary Clusters**: Low, Mid, High  
- **Classification Report**: See console output or Excel file.

---

## Future Improvements
- Add more features such as job roles or education levels to improve prediction accuracy.  
- Implement additional clustering methods to compare results.  
- Create a dynamic dashboard using **Dash** or **Streamlit** for better user interaction.
